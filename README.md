# Google AI4Code â€“ Understand Code in Python Notebooks

This competition was organised by Google and X in the platform Kaggle

## Context of the competition

Research teams across Google and Alphabet are exploring new ways that machine learning can assist software developers, and want to rally more members of the developer community to help explore this area too. Python notebooks provide a unique learning opportunity, because unlike a lot of standard source code, notebooks often follow narrative format, with comment cells implemented in markdown that explain a programmer's intentions for corresponding code cells. An understanding of the relationships between code and markdown could lend to fresh improvements across many aspects of AI-assisted development, such as the construction of better data filtering and preprocessing pipelines for model training, or automatic assessments of a notebook's readability.


## Datasets provided in the competition

They have assembled a dataset of approximately 160,000 public Python notebooks from Kaggle and have teamed up with X
